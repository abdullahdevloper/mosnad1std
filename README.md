# mosnad1std
At the beginning of the time, I built several layers for users and their relationships with content and comments, as well as building communication classes by building the database.... But unfortunately, I was surprised by the supervisor's warning that the time was about to end, which forced me not to complete the construction as I had drawn at the beginning, and thus I did not meet all the requirements mentioned.... Thanks.


 setup
 1-create a database and name it mosnad_database
